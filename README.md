## Local Development

You can open `index.html` directly in a browser, or run a simple local server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

---

## Design Notes

No frontend frameworks or build tools were used intentionally.

The goal was clarity, stability, and ease of maintenance over abstraction.

Secrets (API keys, tokens) are stored as environment variables in Cloudflare and are not committed to the repository.

## Live Site

Hosted on Cloudflare Pages:

```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #2563eb;
  --color-bg: #ffffff;
  --color-text: #0f172a;
}
```
